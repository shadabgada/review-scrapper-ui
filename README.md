# Getting Started with Create React App

- This react-based user interface displays the reviews from Flipkart in a simple, clean, and readable way with an option to filter them on the basis of person name, rating, comment heading, and description
- There are thousands of reviews on Flipkart for some products and it becomes difficult to find specific reviews. This project helps to resolve this problem with the help of a single click
- Consumes a rest API from a Python flask-based scrapper project.
